# Tiger Analytics Internship ‚Äì Data Science Project

## Overview

This repository contains the projects and exercises completed during my **8-week Data Science Internship at Tiger Analytics**. The internship focused on Python programming, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling, with practical application on retail store datasets.


## üìå Internship Modules

### 1. Python Fundamentals

* Developed custom Python functions for **number theory, string manipulation, and list/dictionary operations**.
* Strengthened understanding of loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures.
* **Key Learning:** Writing efficient, reusable Python code for data processing.

### 2. Data Science Concepts

* Performed **data cleaning**, **handling missing values**, and **encoding categorical variables**.
* Applied **descriptive statistics** and correlation analysis to identify patterns.
* **Key Learning:** Understanding the foundation of data-driven insights.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed retail store data to uncover **sales trends, top-performing regions, and store expansion potential**.
* Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps.
* **Insights Derived:**

  * Most profitable product division: **GIRLS**
  * Top months for sales: **December, August, March**
  * Positive correlation between **store size** and **sales**
  * Recommended states for store expansion

### 4. Modeling and Predictive Analysis

* Built **Multiple Linear Regression models** to predict store sales based on key features such as **store size, household income, and population**.
* Evaluated models using **R¬≤, MSE, and MAPE**.
* Explored **regularization techniques** (Ridge, Lasso) to improve model performance.
* **Outcome:** Developed predictive insights to aid retail decision-making.

## üìä Tools & Technologies

* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn
* **Other:** Jupyter Notebook

## üìà Key Learnings

* End-to-end understanding of the **data science workflow** from data collection to modeling.
* Hands-on experience in **data preprocessing, EDA, and predictive modeling**.
* Ability to **derive actionable insights** from real-world datasets.
* Improved **Python programming skills** for data analysis.

## üìù Outcome

* Completed a structured internship with four modules covering Python, Data Science, EDA, and Modeling.
* Generated insights for business decisions related to **sales performance and store expansion**.
* Built a **fully reproducible project repository** demonstrating practical data science skills.
