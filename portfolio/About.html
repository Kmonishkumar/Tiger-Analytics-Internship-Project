            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Monish Kumar K, a passionate and detail-oriented Web Developer with a keen interest in creating
                dynamic, high-performing, and user-friendly websites and web applications. My journey in web development
                started with a curiosity for how websites function, which quickly turned into a full-fledged passion for
                designing and developing interactive digital experiences.
    
                With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in building responsive and
                scalable web solutions that cater to a wide range of user needs. Whether it’s crafting an elegant user
                interface, developing seamless back-end functionality, or optimizing website performance, I strive to
                deliver high-quality, efficient, and engaging web experiences.</p>
